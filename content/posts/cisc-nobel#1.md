### Introduction of the Nobel Foundation

On November 27, 1895, a year before his death, Alfred Nobel signed his famous will, thus fulfilling the goal of his life's work. In his will, Nobel stipulated that his fortune of more than 31 million SEK (about 1.794 billion SEK today) be converted into a fund to be invested in "safe securities." The income from the investment will be "distributed annually in the form of a prize to those who have brought the greatest benefit to humanity during the previous year."

The Nobel Foundation is a private organization established in 1900 according to the will. Its initial goal is to ensure the annual Nobel Prize payment. With the evolution of The Times and the development of the Nobel Prize, the Nobel Foundation has emphasized new functions such as protecting the independence of the awarding institutions and developing the intangible assets of the Nobel Prize on the original basis. The investment policy of the foundation is of course crucial to the preservation of the fund, and a good investment policy will also increase the capital and correspondingly increase the bonus amount.

In the original 1901 investment rules, the term "safe securities" was interpreted at the time to mean gilts, or loans secured by such securities or real estate. However, with the two world Wars and the changes in the economic and financial world that followed, the definition of "safe securities" needed to be reformulated. In the 1950s, at the request of the Nobel Fund's board, the Swedish government allowed it to invest not only in real estate, bonds and guaranteed loans, but also in a wide range of stocks. Although there was a steady decline in prize money from 1901, when the first prizes were awarded (SEK 150,000 each), the liberalization of investment and a long campaign to obtain tax exemptions from the government finally succeeded in 1946, made it possible for the Foundation to reverse this trend. The fund's return gradually overtook the rate of inflation, and the original bonus level was eventually restored in 1991. It is worth noting that the 2023 Nobel Prize is 11 million SEK, an increase of 1 million SEK compared to last year.

The asset management evaluation methods of Nobel Fund are divided into short-term and long-term. The short-term assessment involves both an inflation-adjusted investment target of 3% a year and a reference to a benchmark index. The benchmark index is made up of 55% stocks, 10% bonds, 10% real estate and 25% alternative assets. Its main performance comparison criteria are the Morgan Stanley Capital International Index (44%) and the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index (25%). For the long-term assessment, the Foundation compares its performance with that of other publicly available Nordic institutional investors as a reference to the level of the foundation's asset management.

### Management scale

In terms of monetary value in 2022, the management scale of the Nobel Foundation was 1.8 billion SEK (Swedish kronor) at the beginning of its foundation in 1901, and has more than tripled to 5.8 billion SEK in 2022. From the data intercepted since 2000, it can be seen from the line chart that its management scale in recent years is relatively stable and has an obvious upward trend.

### Asset allocation methodology

**1. Diversify investments**

The Nobel Foundation's asset allocation strategy is clearly characterized by diversification. Its portfolio includes equity, fixed income, alternative investments (such as hedge funds), real estate and infrastructure funds.

**2. Alternative asset investment**

The proportion of alternative assets in the Nobel Fund is second only to equity funds, accounting for about 22%. This category of assets includes private and public market assets, which have reduced liquidity, low correlation with the market, and a greater emphasis on robustness.

The Nobel Fund's portfolio includes equity investments, real estate funds, fixed income investments, and alternative assets such as hedge funds. In 2022, for example, its portfolio will consist of 53% equity investments, 9% real estate funds, 17% fixed income investments and 22% alternative assets. The allocations vary from year to year in a small range, such as the 2021 portfolio consisting of 55% equity investments, 8% real estate funds, 16% fixed income investments, 24% alternative assets, and (-2%) deferred currency hedging gains.

The Nobel Foundation invests most of its money in equities and alternative assets, reflecting the growth-oriented nature of its portfolio. It spans multiple asset classes, from stable fixed income to risky equity and alternative assets, demonstrating a clear diversification strategy aimed at balancing risk and return. The existence of fixed income assets and cash provides a certain amount of capital safety cushion and liquidity, helping to mitigate possible downside risks in the market.

As Swedish inflation remains high and interest rates continue to rise due to tight monetary policy, driving up investment costs, the foundation has reduced its holdings of Swedish stocks by about 5% and correspondingly increased its exposure to private equity. Most of the assets are still invested in global equities, reflecting the characteristics of portfolio diversification and hedging against exchange rate movements.

Swedish interest rates rose and Swedish bonds continued to fall in value. So the foundation cut its holdings of Swedish bonds by more than half and increased its cash holdings significantly to build up a precautionary cash reserve.
