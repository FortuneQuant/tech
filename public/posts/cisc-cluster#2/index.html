<p>We use K-means algorithm to cluster the daily return data of 28 industry indexes, reduce dimension into five indexes, and do equal weight average of the relative net worth of each industry included. The industry distribution covered by each index is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Index 1: Non-ferrous metals, Basic chemical industry, Building materials, Light industrial manufacturing, Machinery, Agriculture, Forestry, Animal husbandry and fishery, Banking, Communications, Media</li>
<li>Index 2: Steel, Retail, Transportation</li>

<p>During the period from 2016 to 2019, the excess return of Index 3 relative to the whole market reached 57.0%. Among them, the excess income of food and beverage and home appliances is the largest, respectively 151.2% and 88.9%, ranking the top two in all industries.</p>
<p>In 2016-2017, a resonance occurred both at home and abroad in fundamental sectors. Also, the supply-side reform, which caused the nominal growth rate of China&rsquo;s economy to rebound. Corporate profits have improved, and traditional industries such as food and beverage have led to catalyze a round of &ldquo;slow bull&rdquo; market. Historical data show that the growth rate of household income has a lagging effect on the growth rate of nominal GDP. The data of the first and second quarters of 2017 show that the growth rate of resident income has rebounded significantly, and the consumption sector led by food and home appliances has increased significantly, reflecting the important logic of the large consumption cycle.</p>

<p>Between 2020 and 2021, Indices 3 and 5 will have outperformed returns relative to the whole market of 3.5% and 35.1%, respectively. The other indexes underperformed the market, with Index 4 underperforming the market by 16%.

During this period, interest rates fell, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged from 0 to 0.25%, and the global pattern of ultra-low interest rates continued. With the emergence of ultra-low interest rates, the yield of fixed income products has declined, making it less attractive to invest, and the profits of non-bank financial institutions that originally took fixed income products as the main investment object have been negatively affected. At the same time, a number of real estate enterprises exploded. In the case of the policy of &ldquo;Houses are for living, not for speculation; policies should be tailored to each city.&rdquo;, the real estate financing continues to be locked. The multiple pressures of land restriction, sales pressure, and financing obstruction have led to the severing of the capital chain of many housing enterprises, which has led to debt default and bankruptcy reorganization.</p>

In the index 4, the excess of coal, petroleum and petrochemical is 55.6% and 26.2%, ranking the top two in the industry. In February 2022, the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out, and the spot price of coal market showed high volatility due to the combination of factors such as rising international energy prices and landing of new energy facilities. In addition, the central government has introduced high-quality development measures for petroleum and petrochemical industries to help the reform of traditional fossil energy and promote the structural transformation of the petroleum and petrochemical industries.</p>
