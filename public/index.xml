&lt;p&gt;We use K-means algorithm to cluster the daily return data of 28 industry indexes, reduce dimension into five indexes, and do equal weight average of the relative net worth of each industry included. The industry distribution covered by each index is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Index 1: Non-ferrous metals, Basic chemical industry, Building materials, Light industrial manufacturing, Machinery, Agriculture, Forestry, Animal husbandry and fishery, Banking, Communications, Media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Index 2: Steel, Retail, Transportation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Index 3: Home appliances, Food and beverage, Electronic components, Computers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Index 4: Petroleum and petrochemicals, Coal, Power and utilities, Construction, Textiles and apparel, Non-bank finance, Real estate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Index 5: Power equipment, National defense, Automobiles, Catering and tourism, Medicine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the overall trend point of view, Index 3 and 5 outperform the market for a long time, Index 1 is close to the market, and Index 2 and 4 are weak. Index 3 and 5 have obvious positive correlation, and Index 2 has negative correlation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The excess returns of Index 3 and Index 5 from 2010 to 2015 relative to the whole market reached 63.9% and 41.8% respectively, ranking the top two among the five indexes. The excess returns of computer and electronic components in Index 3 in this range are 152.3% and 82.4%, respectively, which are in the top five of the 28 CITIC industries. Since 2010, a large number of smart phones have been shipped, and high-tech fields such as electronic computers have ushered in a large increase; In 2013, with the advent of the Internet era, computer, media and other TMT sectors performed prominently; In 2015, the state introduced a number of reform policies and policy guidance, including &amp;ldquo;Internet +&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;mass entrepreneurship and innovation&amp;rdquo;, which aroused market enthusiasm and rapid development of the computer and electronics industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the excess returns of catering and tourism and medicine in Index 5 are also obvious, at 111.1% and 57.9% respectively, ranking the top five among the 28 industries. After the financial crisis, medicine has become one of the few industries with sustained and stable high performance, and its ROE has basically remained above 10%, so it is favored by investors. Subsequently, various places in the pharmaceutical industry to control the cost of price reduction to a certain extent, resulting in frequent security incidents, to give the pharmaceutical industry a reasonable profit call to increase, since 2013, the performance of pharmaceutical companies gradually picked up, the industry increased by 35.2% throughout the year, ranking in the top of all industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the period from 2016 to 2019, the excess return of Index 3 relative to the whole market reached 57.0%. Among them, the excess income of food and beverage and home appliances is the largest, respectively 151.2% and 88.9%, ranking the top two in all industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016-2017, a resonance occurred both at home and abroad in fundamental sectors. Also, the supply-side reform, which caused the nominal growth rate of China&amp;rsquo;s economy to rebound. Corporate profits have improved, and traditional industries such as food and beverage have led to catalyze a round of &amp;ldquo;slow bull&amp;rdquo; market. Historical data show that the growth rate of household income has a lagging effect on the growth rate of nominal GDP. The data of the first and second quarters of 2017 show that the growth rate of resident income has rebounded significantly, and the consumption sector led by food and home appliances has increased significantly, reflecting the important logic of the large consumption cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the China-US trade friction began, the market fell across the board, from the style of the blue-chip market against the decline, the food and beverage industry cash flow is stable, the asset-liability ratio is low, and the ability to fight the economic downturn is strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, the overfall of the previous year was repaired, and the industry showed a clear two-wheel drive market of consumption and technology, with food and beverage, home appliances and computers rising 25.8%, 21.5% and 11.1%, respectively, ranking among the few positive excess industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2020 and 2021, Indices 3 and 5 will have outperformed returns relative to the whole market of 3.5% and 35.1%, respectively. The other indexes underperformed the market, with Index 4 underperforming the market by 16%. Index 5 rose significantly, including the power equipment and automotive industries rose 91.8% and 31.5% respectively. A new round of energy reform is the theme of this stage, the use of greener and cleaner electric energy to gradually replace fossil energy has become the trend of The Times, coupled with China&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;carbon neutral&amp;rdquo; goal and the energy policy proposed by the United States, power equipment and new energy vehicles have developed rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Index 4 non-bank finance, real estate fell by more than 37%, the largest decline in all industries. During this period, interest rates fell, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged from 0 to 0.25%, and the global pattern of ultra-low interest rates continued. With the emergence of ultra-low interest rates, the yield of fixed income products has declined, making it less attractive to invest, and the profits of non-bank financial institutions that originally took fixed income products as the main investment object have been negatively affected. At the same time, a number of real estate enterprises exploded. In the case of the policy of &amp;ldquo;Houses are for living, not for speculation; policies should be tailored to each city.&amp;rdquo;, the real estate financing continues to be locked. The multiple pressures of land restriction, sales pressure, and financing obstruction have led to the severing of the capital chain of many housing enterprises, which has led to debt default and bankruptcy reorganization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the beginning of 2022 to now, Index 4 has reached a higher excess return of 19% relative to the whole market, and the trend of other indexes has stabilized. In the index 4, the excess of coal, petroleum and petrochemical is 55.6% and 26.2%, ranking the top two in the industry. In February 2022, the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out, and the spot price of coal market showed high volatility due to the combination of factors such as rising international energy prices and landing of new energy facilities. In addition, the central government has introduced high-quality development measures for petroleum and petrochemical industries to help the reform of traditional fossil energy and promote the structural transformation of the petroleum and petrochemical industries.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Nobel Foundation</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/tech/posts/cisc-nobel_1/</link>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction-of-the-nobel-foundation&#34;&gt;Introduction of the Nobel Foundation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 27, 1895, a year before his death, Alfred Nobel signed his famous will, thus fulfilling the goal of his life&amp;rsquo;s work. In his will, Nobel stipulated that his fortune of more than 31 million SEK (about 1.794 billion SEK today) be converted into a fund to be invested in &amp;ldquo;safe securities.&amp;rdquo; The income from the investment will be &amp;ldquo;distributed annually in the form of a prize to those who have brought the greatest benefit to humanity during the previous year.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nobel Foundation is a private organization established in 1900 according to the will. Its initial goal is to ensure the annual Nobel Prize payment. With the evolution of The Times and the development of the Nobel Prize, the Nobel Foundation has emphasized new functions such as protecting the independence of the awarding institutions and developing the intangible assets of the Nobel Prize on the original basis. The investment policy of the foundation is of course crucial to the preservation of the fund, and a good investment policy will also increase the capital and correspondingly increase the bonus amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the original 1901 investment rules, the term &amp;ldquo;safe securities&amp;rdquo; was interpreted at the time to mean gilts, or loans secured by such securities or real estate. However, with the two world Wars and the changes in the economic and financial world that followed, the definition of &amp;ldquo;safe securities&amp;rdquo; needed to be reformulated. In the 1950s, at the request of the Nobel Fund&amp;rsquo;s board, the Swedish government allowed it to invest not only in real estate, bonds and guaranteed loans, but also in a wide range of stocks. Although there was a steady decline in prize money from 1901, when the first prizes were awarded (SEK 150,000 each), the liberalization of investment and a long campaign to obtain tax exemptions from the government finally succeeded in 1946, made it possible for the Foundation to reverse this trend. The fund&amp;rsquo;s return gradually overtook the rate of inflation, and the original bonus level was eventually restored in 1991. It is worth noting that the 2023 Nobel Prize is 11 million SEK, an increase of 1 million SEK compared to last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The asset management evaluation methods of Nobel Fund are divided into short-term and long-term. The short-term assessment involves both an inflation-adjusted investment target of 3% a year and a reference to a benchmark index. The benchmark index is made up of 55% stocks, 10% bonds, 10% real estate and 25% alternative assets. Its main performance comparison criteria are the Morgan Stanley Capital International Index (44%) and the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index (25%). For the long-term assessment, the Foundation compares its performance with that of other publicly available Nordic institutional investors as a reference to the level of the foundation&amp;rsquo;s asset management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;management-scale&#34;&gt;Management scale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img

  loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
  decoding=&#34;async&#34;
  class=&#34;full-width&#34;
/&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of monetary value in 2022, the management scale of the Nobel Foundation was 1.8 billion SEK (Swedish kronor) at the beginning of its foundation in 1901, and has more than tripled to 5.8 billion SEK in 2022. From the data intercepted since 2000, it can be seen from the line chart that its management scale in recent years is relatively stable and has an obvious upward trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;asset-allocation-methodology&#34;&gt;Asset allocation methodology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Diversify investments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nobel Foundation&amp;rsquo;s asset allocation strategy is clearly characterized by diversification. Its portfolio includes equity, fixed income, alternative investments (such as hedge funds), real estate and infrastructure funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Alternative asset investment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proportion of alternative assets in the Nobel Fund is second only to equity funds, accounting for about 22%. This category of assets includes private and public market assets, which have reduced liquidity, low correlation with the market, and a greater emphasis on robustness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nobel Fund&amp;rsquo;s portfolio includes equity investments, real estate funds, fixed income investments, and alternative assets such as hedge funds. In 2022, for example, its portfolio will consist of 53% equity investments, 9% real estate funds, 17% fixed income investments and 22% alternative assets. The allocations vary from year to year in a small range, such as the 2021 portfolio consisting of 55% equity investments, 8% real estate funds, 16% fixed income investments, 24% alternative assets, and (-2%) deferred currency hedging gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nobel Foundation invests most of its money in equities and alternative assets, reflecting the growth-oriented nature of its portfolio. It spans multiple asset classes, from stable fixed income to risky equity and alternative assets, demonstrating a clear diversification strategy aimed at balancing risk and return. The existence of fixed income assets and cash provides a certain amount of capital safety cushion and liquidity, helping to mitigate possible downside risks in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

/&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Swedish inflation remains high and interest rates continue to rise due to tight monetary policy, driving up investment costs, the foundation has reduced its holdings of Swedish stocks by about 5% and correspondingly increased its exposure to private equity. Most of the assets are still invested in global equities, reflecting the characteristics of portfolio diversification and hedging against exchange rate movements.&lt;/p&gt;

/&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swedish interest rates rose and Swedish bonds continued to fall in value. So the foundation cut its holdings of Swedish bonds by more than half and increased its cash holdings significantly to build up a precautionary cash reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
